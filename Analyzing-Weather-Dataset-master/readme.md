# Analyzing Weather Dataset
This is a data analytics project utilizing SQL and Python v.3 libraries Numpy, PANDAS and Matplotlib through Jupyter Notebook in order to provide a quick comparative analysis between of weather trends globally and a specific city. I opted for Los Angeles, CA as that is the city I currently reside in.

# Required Software:
<li> <a href=https://jupyter.org/install>Jupyter Notebook</a>
<li> <a href=https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html>Numpy</a>
<li> <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/>PANDAS</a>
<li> <a href=https://matplotlib.org/>Matplotlib</a>

# Analytics Outline:
<li> Extract & download data as CSV files from SQL database.
<li> Calculate the moving average using .rolling.mean() function.
<li> Visualize data using line charts from the Matplotlib library.
<li> Document observations about the data.
